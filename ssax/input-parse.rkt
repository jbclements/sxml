;			Simple Parsing of input
;
; The following simple functions surprisingly often suffice to parse
; an input stream. They either skip, or build and return tokens,
; according to inclusion or delimiting semantics. The list of
; characters to expect, include, or to break at may vary from one
; invocation of a function to another. This allows the functions to
; easily parse even context-sensitive languages.
;
; EOF is generally frowned on, and thrown up upon if encountered.
; Exceptions are mentioned specifically. The list of expected characters 
; (characters to skip until, or break-characters) may include an EOF
; "character", which is to be coded as symbol *eof*
;
; The input stream to parse is specified as a PORT, which is usually
; the last (and optional) argument. It defaults to the current input
; port if omitted.
;
; IMPORT
; This package relies on a function parser-error, which must be defined
; by a user of the package. The function has the following signature:
;	parser-error PORT MESSAGE SPECIALISING-MSG*
; Many procedures of this package call parser-error to report a parsing
; error.  The first argument is a port, which typically points to the
; offending character or its neighborhood. Most of the Scheme systems
; let the user query a PORT for the current position. MESSAGE is the
; description of the error. Other arguments supply more details about
; the problem.

;		     Preparation and tuning section

; This package is heavily used. Therefore, we take time to tune it in,
; in particular for Gambit.


; Concise and efficient definition of a function that takes one or two
; optional arguments, e.g.,
;
; (define-opt (foo arg1 arg2 (optional (arg3 init3) (arg4 init4))) body)
;
; define-opt is identical to a regular define, with one exception: the
; last argument may have a form
;	(optional (binding init) ... )

(define-syntax (define-opt stx)
  (syntax-case stx ()
    [(_ (name req-param ... (optional (opt-param opt-default) ...)) . body)
     #'(define (name req-param ... [opt-param opt-default] ...) . body)]
    [(_ (name . formals) . body)
     #'(define (name . formals) . body)]
    [(_ name expr)
     (identifier? #'name)
     #'(define name expr)]))

;------------------------------------------------------------------------

; -- procedure+: peek-next-char [PORT]
; 	advances to the next character in the PORT and peeks at it.
; 	This function is useful when parsing LR(1)-type languages
; 	(one-char-read-ahead).
;	The optional argument PORT defaults to the current input port.

; -- procedure+: assert-curr-char CHAR-LIST STRING [PORT]
;	Reads a character from the PORT and looks it up
;	in the CHAR-LIST of expected characters
;	If the read character was found among expected, it is returned
;	Otherwise, the procedure writes a nasty message using STRING
;	as a comment, and quits.
;	The optional argument PORT defaults to the current input port.

; -- procedure+: skip-until CHAR-LIST [PORT]
;	Reads and skips characters from the PORT until one of the break
;	characters is encountered. This break character is returned.
;	The break characters are specified as the CHAR-LIST. This list
;	may include EOF, which is to be coded as a symbol *eof*
;
; -- procedure+: skip-until NUMBER [PORT]
;	Skips the specified NUMBER of characters from the PORT and returns #f
;
;	The optional argument PORT defaults to the current input port.

; -- procedure+: skip-while CHAR-LIST [PORT]
;	Reads characters from the PORT and disregards them,

;				Stream tokenizers


; -- procedure+: 
;    next-token PREFIX-CHAR-LIST BREAK-CHAR-LIST [COMMENT-STRING] [PORT]
;	skips any number of the prefix characters (members of the
;	PREFIX-CHAR-LIST), if any, and reads the sequence of characters
;	up to (but not including) a break character, one of the
;	BREAK-CHAR-LIST.
;	The string of characters thus read is returned.
;	The break character is left on the input stream
;	The list of break characters may include EOF, which is to be coded as
;	a symbol *eof*. Otherwise, EOF is fatal, generating an error message
;	including a specified COMMENT-STRING (if any)
;
;	The optional argument PORT defaults to the current input port.
;
; Note: since we can't tell offhand how large the token being read is
; going to be, we make a guess, pre-allocate a string, and grow it by
; quanta if necessary. The quantum is always the length of the string
; before it was extended the last time. Thus the algorithm does
; a Fibonacci-type extension, which has been proven optimal.
; Note, explicit port specification in read-char, peek-char helps.

; Procedure input-parse:init-buffer
; returns an initial buffer for next-token* procedures.
; The input-parse:init-buffer may allocate a new buffer per each invocation:
;	(define (input-parse:init-buffer) (make-string 32))
; Size 32 turns out to be fairly good, on average.
; That policy is good only when a Scheme system is multi-threaded with
; preemptive scheduling, or when a Scheme system supports shared substrings.
; In all the other cases, it's better for input-parse:init-buffer to
; return the same static buffer. next-token* functions return a copy
; (a substring) of accumulated data, so the same buffer can be reused.
; We shouldn't worry about new token being too large: next-token will use
; a larger buffer automatically. Still, the best size for the static buffer
; is to allow most of the tokens to fit in.
; Using a static buffer _dramatically_ reduces the amount of produced garbage
; (e.g., during XML parsing).

; -- procedure+: next-token-of INC-CHARSET [PORT]
;	Reads characters from the PORT that belong to the list of characters
;	INC-CHARSET. The reading stops at the first character which is not
;	a member of the set. This character is left on the stream.
;	All the read characters are returned in a string.
;
; -- procedure+: next-token-of PRED [PORT]
;	Reads characters from the PORT for which PRED (a procedure of one
;	argument) returns non-#f. The reading stops at the first character
;	for which PRED returns #f. That character is left on the stream.
;	All the results of evaluating of PRED up to #f are returned in a
;	string.
;
;	PRED is a procedure that takes one argument (a character
;	or the EOF object) and returns a character or #f. The returned
;	character does not have to be the same as the input argument
;	to the PRED. For example,
;	(next-token-of (lambda (c)
;			  (cond ((eof-object? c) #f)
;				((char-alphabetic? c) (char-downcase c))
;				(else #f))))
;	will try to read an alphabetic token from the current
;	input port, and return it in lower case.
; 
;	The optional argument PORT defaults to the current input port.
;
; Note: since we can't tell offhand how large the token being read is
; going to be, we make a guess, pre-allocate a string, and grow it by
; quanta if necessary. The quantum is always the length of the string
; before it was extended the last time. Thus the algorithm does
; a Fibonacci-type extension, which has been proven optimal.
;
; This procedure is similar to next-token but only it implements
; an inclusion rather than delimiting semantics.
