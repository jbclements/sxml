 This planet library contains Oleg Kiselyov's SXML 
 libraries in a Racket-friendly format. It is a direct descendant of 
 Dmitry Lizorkin's PLaneT package.  It's different from that package in that
 
 @itemize[#:style 'ordered
 @item{It contains some documentation (here it is!),}
 @item{it contains some tests that run in Racket,}
 @item{it raises racket exceptions rather than printing to stderr and raising "-1",}
 @item{it has only one require point (ssax & sxml are both included), and}
 @item{it doesn't depend on schemeunit:3, so it compiles quickly.}]
 
 This documentation is scraped together from various sources; the bulk of it
 (currently) is pulled from in-source comments.
 
 I'm hoping that this will become a Racket community project, with various
 people contributing documentation and test cases and maybe even bug fixes.
 
 To that end, this code currently lives in a github repository which should
 be fairly easy to find.  Patches gratefully accepted.
 
 For Heaven's sake, report lots of bugs!
