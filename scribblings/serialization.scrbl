 Serializes the SXML node or nodeset @racket[sxml-obj] into XML, with
 indentation to facilitate readability by a human.

 If @racket[dest] is not supplied, the function returns a string that
 contains the serialized representation of the @racket[sxml-obj].  If
 @racket[dest] is supplied and is a port, the functions write the
 serialized representation of @racket[sxml-obj] to this port.  If
 @racket[dest] is supplied and is a string, this string is treated as
 an output filename, the serialized representation of
 @racket[sxml-obj] is written to that filename. If a file with the
 given name already exists, the effect is unspecified.
